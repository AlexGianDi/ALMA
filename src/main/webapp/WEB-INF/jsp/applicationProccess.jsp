					<p class="text-justify">Greek Golden Visa application process has a fairly straightforward order. As the first step, the applicant must submit an application for an entry visa to the Greek consulate authority in their country of origin. Then, they should collect and provide the necessary documents. After that, the documents must be submitted to the one-stop service of the Alien and Immigration Department at the Decentralised Authority where the property of the interested party is located. The applicant must submit all the necessary documents before the expiry date of the entry visa. Finally, the applicant should undertake legal acts and transactions with the competent authorities, using their entry visa.
